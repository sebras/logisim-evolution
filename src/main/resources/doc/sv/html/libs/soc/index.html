    <h1>System On Chip components library</h1>
    <p>The system on chip components library contain all components required to
      perform a functional simulation of a system on chip.</p>

    <h2>Minimal requirements for a successful simulation</h2>
    <p>To be able to perform a System On Chip (SOC) simulation you require to
      have in your sheet at least:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>One of the processors marked with the <img src="../../../../icons/up.png"
          alt="up" title="up">-icon.</li>
      <li>One bus marked with the <img src="../../../../icons/socbus.png" alt="socbus"
          title="socbus">-icon.</li>
      <li>One memory simulator marked with the <img src="../../../../icons/socmem.png"
          alt="socmem" title="socmem">-icon.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Furthermore, both the memory simulator and the processor need to be
      connected to the bus. This can be achieved by defining the <em><strong>Connected
          bus</strong></em> attribute of the respective components.</p>
    <h2>Restrictions</h2>
    <p>A SOC system can only be local on one sheet, meaning that a given bus
      component is only visible on the sheet it is placed. Building hierarchical
      systems is only possible when having the base system on one sheet and the
      extensions, for example VHDL-extentions or circuits, connected through the
      base system by means of input- and output pins.</p>
    <h2>Simulation speed</h2>
    <p>One has to realize that this library is intended to visualize what is
      going on in a SOC. Hence it provides in no way the means to perform (near)
      real-time simulations of your SOC. For this purpose more adequate systems
      are for example <a href="https://www.qemu.org" target="_blank">QEMU</a>.
    </p>
    <p>On the test system with all parts of the system visible a maximum of 3 Hz
      tick-frequency was measured. Disabling some of the details for faster
      simulation improved the speed to 8 Hz. The best simulation speed can be
      achieved to use super-circuits with dynamic elements. Here the simulation
      speed went up to approx. 3kHz.</p>
