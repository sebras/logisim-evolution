    <h1>Disassembler</h1>
    <p><img src="../../../../img-libs/disassembler.png" alt="disassembler" title="disassembler"><br>
    </p>
    <p>The disassembler takes the program stored in memory and transforms it to
      a human readable contents. If available the disassembler uses the elf
      section headers to extract defined labels and sections. Otherwise it uses
      directly the information stored in memory to decode the information. The
      disassembler has some features that are described below.</p>
    <h2>Automatic label detection</h2>
    <p>Where possible the disassembler tries to automatically detect labels in
      your program. The detected labels will be called <em><strong>logisim_label_&lt;x&gt;</strong>&nbsp;
        </em>where <strong>&lt;x&gt;</strong> is a number starting with 1. The
      labels are ordered from top to bottom, such that searching for a label is
      facilitated.</p>
    <h2>Automatic program counter and opcode insertion</h2>
    <p>After each line where an instruction is detected the disassembler will
      insert a remark containing the program counter (pc) value and the
      instruction's binary opcode.</p>
    <h2>Break point support</h2>
    <p>The disassembler supports breakpoints. Breakpoints can be set/cleared by
      either clicking in the left vertical bar next to the instruction, or by
      selecting a line and pressing the <strong>b</strong> or clicking on
      either the button <em>Add break point</em> or <em>Remove break point</em>.</p>
    <p>The moment the cpu reaches a break point it will stop executing and the <a
        href="socsimcontrol.html">simulation state controller</a> will indicate
      a break point reached. The instruction next to the break point will not be
      executed. Finally upon reaching a break point the disassembler will
      automatically jump to the line at which the break point is encountered.<br>
